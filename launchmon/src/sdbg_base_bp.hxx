//! FILE: sdbg_base_bp.hxx
/*!
    The file contains the base class for breakpoint objects.
    The templated breakpoint_base_t gets instantiated by 
    a platform-specific layer in regards to the virtual address
    type and the instruction type. 

    Since most of the archtecture employ a trap instruction
    to implement the breakpoint, this class carries the trap 
    instruction itself around.

    Note that one should only put platform independent logics
    into this file.

/*!
    The platform-independent breakpoint class. A platform
    specific layer should provide this with a virtual 
    address type and an instruction type.

    A noteworthy feature is that this class attemps to blend
    the original instruction with the provided trap instruction
    to implement a breakpoint instruction. In addition, it supports
    indirect call.
