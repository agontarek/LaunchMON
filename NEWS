2009-06-30 DHA Release a 0.7 beta version (0.7.2beta) 
	        o Added new Cray XT4/5/6, OpenRTE and BlueGene/P 
		  RM platform support in addition to existing 
	     	  BlueGene/L and SLURM
	        o Integrated the scalable version of PMGR, a.k.a. 
		  COBO, and set it as the default bootfabric
		o Ran scaling tests and validated the scalability 
		  at over 100K MPI processes on BlueGene/P and 
		  over 200K MPI processes on Cray XT5
		o Augmented LMON FE API set while maintaining 
	          backward compatibility of the existing API: 
		   - LMON_fe_regErrorCB call
		   - LMON_fe_getRMInfo call
		   - LMON_DONT_STOP_APP environment variable	
		o Added better performance and scalabilty testing 
		  support with the --enable-tracing-cost config option
		o Worked out the error handling semantics and enforced 
		  it on the supported RMs; the semantics is documented
	  	  in README.ERROR_HANDLING as well as the man page
		  of LMON_fe_[launch|attach]SpawnDaemons
		o Added a two-phased priority polling scheme into 
		  the LaunchMON engine
		o Better GNU AUTO build scripts and configure 
		  parameters support
