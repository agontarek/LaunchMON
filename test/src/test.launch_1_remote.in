#  Launch a fully populated job at $NUMTASK and co-locate daemons, 
#  one daemon per node, which unlocks the initial hang of all tasks. 
#  A difference with test.launch_1 is that this case locates a launcthmon 
#  engine remotely on a node in which the job launcher process runs.
#
#  Update Log:
#        Dec 02 2013 DHA: Added new LaunchMON engine support.
#        Oct 21 2011 DHA: Added dynamic RM detection support.
#        Mar 06 2009 DHA: Changed bglrm to bgrm
#        Dec 14 2008 DHA: configurable NUMNODES
#        Jun 13 2008 DHA: Created file.
